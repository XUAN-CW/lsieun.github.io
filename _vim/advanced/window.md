These are the most important commands, but you should look at `:help split`.

- `:split` → create a split (`:vsplit` create a vertical split)
- `<C-w><dir>`: where `dir` is any of `hjkl` or `←↓↑→` to change the split.
- `<C-w>_` (resp. `<C-w>|`) : maximise the size of the split (resp. vertical split)
- `<C-w>+` (resp. `<C-w>-`) : Grow (resp. shrink) split
